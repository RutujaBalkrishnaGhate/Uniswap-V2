## Final Project: Upgrade UniswapV2

<h3>Final Project: Upgrade UniswapV2</h3>
<p>UniswapV2 was written three years ago and uses outdated versions of Solidity tools</p>
<h4>Project goals:</h4>
<p>Achieve deep knowledge of the UniswapV2 implementation<br>
Learn Foundry, the next generation ethereum development environment<br>
You may use any online resources for the project.<br></p>
<h6>Read through the UniswapV2 code:</h6>
<p>https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core<br>
https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery</br>
Class Notes (written by Jichu Wang, a former student at NEU).<br>
Copy the UniswapV2 code into a new Foundry project<br>
The original code had the core and periphery contracts in different repos. We recommend combining them into a single repo to simplify development, and copying libraries rather than using package management.
UniswapV2Router01 should not be included.<br>
Upgrade the UniswapV2 code to the latest Solidity version that Foundry supports.<br>
<h6>Write Solidity tests that achieve 100% line coverage for each of the following contracts:</h6>
<ul>
<li>UniswapV2Router02</li>
<li>UniswapV2Pair</li>
<li>UniswapV2Factory</li></ul>
Generate and commit a line coverage report to assess the quality of your tests

IDE used to run the code is VS Studio Code.
